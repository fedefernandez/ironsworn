## Session 04 - A Mystical Place

![](img/session_04.jpg)

After my latest day, I began my journey with the hope of finding a better companion for both my mind and body. I felt a bit exhausted at first, but as I started putting one foot in front of the other, I began to feel better.

After a long trek, I discovered the entrance to a cave. I could see some light streaming in from outside, which filled me with enough confidence to enter. A completely dark cave would have been much more concerning, but this one appeared almost cozy.

Once I stepped inside, my best wishes were fulfilled. At last, some good luck! This cave seemed to be abandoned, once belonging to some kind of mystic. Regardless, it provided a great place to spend the night.

It also had a back courtyard filled with vegetables. I dug carefully and collected the fruits I found there.

> 5+3 - 3,1 *Strong Hit*

> +2 Supply, -1 Momentum

The rest of the night was wonderful. Iâ€™m not sure if it was the mystic presence of the place, but I experienced restorative dreams.
