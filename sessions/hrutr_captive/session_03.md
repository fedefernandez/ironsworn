## Session 03 - The Narrow Path

With the last remnants of daylight slipping behind the mountains, I set off on the journey home, my heart buoyed by the whispers of nature that guided my way. The rustling leaves and the soft murmur of the wind felt like gentle hands, steering me back through the labyrinth of trees and shadows.

After what seemed an eternity on the winding paths, I arrived at a clearing that beckoned me to pause—a sanctuary of sorts, albeit temporary. It was the perfect moment to rest and gather my strength for the uncertainties that lay ahead.

Yet, as I surveyed the area, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this place was far from ideal for setting up camp. The twilight deepened, and I could sense the presence of unseen watchers, their gazes seeping into the darkening corners.

The air was thick with humidity, wrapping around me like a heavy cloak—an unwelcome shroud that promised little comfort. I quickly gathered my gear, desperate to create some semblance of a safe haven, even as the night grew more alive around me. 

The hours dragged on, and sleep eluded me, replaced instead by the gnawing sensation of unease. Each rustle outside my thin fabric walls echoed like a portent, sealing the fate of my restless night.

In the end, I realized that fear is a poor companion for rest, leaving me more weary than the journey itself. 

I knew one of my captives; an old member of my settlement that was expelled because of serious crimes. I have the feeling he was part of it and contributed to the assault.
