# Hrutr the captive

## Session 01 - The Rerrifying Bear

After wandering for several days blindfolded [discovered in the second session], one day, as night approached, a loud blow sent me rolling down the hill, preceded by a bestial roar.

When I managed to remove the blindfold, I discovered how my captors were facing a terrifying bear, suffering a terrible fate.

> **Enter the Fray**
> 
> 4+3 - 2,7 *Weak Hit*
> 
> Take Initiative

> **Strike**
> 
> 4+3 - 7,7 *Miss with Match*
> 
> You must pay the price. Bear take initiative

I stepped into the fray, the cold wind biting at my skin as the bear emerged from the shadows. Its hulking form moved silently through the underbrush, muscles rippling beneath thick fur. Gripping my spear tightly, I steadied my breath, preparing for the inevitable clash. I lunged first, but the bear was faster—too fast. It swatted my spear aside with a brutal force that sent me reeling. I had the initiative for a brief moment, but the beast charged, demanding its price in blood.

> I rolled in the action and them oracles, this is what I got: *"Demand Duty, Act Against Your Interest"*

> **Face Danger**
> 
> 2+2 - 1,5 *Weak Hit*
> 
> Take the spear, -1 Harm

> **Endure Harm**
> 
> 6+3 - 4,4 *Strong Hit with Match*
> 
> -1 Momentum +1 Health. I take the initiative

In the chaos, I acted against my better judgment, driven by desperation. I snatched up my spear and faced the beast once more. The blow landed, but only grazed its thick hide. The bear retaliated fiercely, its claws tearing at my flesh. Pain surged through me, but I stood firm, enduring the agony. I wouldn’t fall—not yet.

> **Strike**
> 
> 5+3 - 2,10 *Weak Hit*
> 
> Apply +2 Harm (2 progress). Bear take initiative.

> **Face Danger with Skirmisher Combar Talent**
> 
> 3+3 - 5,9 *Weak Hit*
> 
> -1 Supply.

Gritting my teeth, I launched another attack, this time driving the spear deep into its side. The bear howled in rage, but it wasn’t enough. It wrested the momentum back, forcing me into a frantic skirmish. My supplies were dwindling, my spirit fraying at the edges. Doubt gnawed at me, but I couldn’t afford to stop. I pressed on, driven by sheer will.

> **Clash**
> 
> 2+4 - 6,7 *Miss*
> 
> You must pay the price

> Asked the oracle, is the spear broken? (50/50) 46, No!
> 
> Applied Stressful situation, -3 spirit

> **Endure Stress**
> 
> 6+3 - 9,4 *Weak Hit*
>
> Press on

> **Face Danger with Skirmisher Combar Talent**
> 
> 2+3 - 3,10 *Weak Hit*
> -1 Momentum

> **Clash**
> 
> 3+4 - 7,7 *Miss with a Match*
> 
> -3 health, reached 0

> **Endure Harm**
> 
> 6+3 - 2,4 *Strong Hit*
> 
> Embrace the pain. +1 Momentum, I take the initiative

> **Strike**
> 
> 6+3 - 8,9 *Weak Hit*
> 
> Apply +2 Harm (2 progress). Bear take the initiative

Then it happened—a crushing blow from the bear that nearly broke me. My body screamed in protest as I fell, health draining fast. Death loomed, but somehow, I embraced the pain, clawing back from the brink. I found a moment of clarity, seized the chance, and struck hard. My spear hit its mark, but still, the bear fought on. My hands trembled, momentum slipping away, but I refused to back down.

> **Face Danger with Skirmisher Combar Talent**
> 
> 3+6 - 5,5 Strong Hit with a Match
> 
> Charge death (Oracle). +1 next roll. I take the initiative

> **Strike**
> 
> 4+5 - 1,9 *Weak Hit*
> 
> Apply +2 Harm (2 progress). Bear take the initiative

> **Face Danger with Skirmisher Combar Talent**
> 
> 1+3 - 1,7 *Weak Hit*
> 
> -1 Momentum

And then fate turned in my favor. With a burst of energy, I charged recklessly, spear in hand, fear forgotten. The weapon pierced the bear’s heart. It staggered, its strength failing at last. One final clash, one last surge of resolve, and I drove the killing blow.

> **Clash**
> 
> 4+4 - 1,7 Strong Hit
> 
> Apply +2 Harm (2 progress, reaching 10). I take the initiative
  
> **End Fight**
> 
> Challenge dies: 9,8 against 10. Finished 

The bear collapsed at my feet, its breath ragged and fading until, finally, it was still. I stood over it, victorious, but the cost had been steep.
