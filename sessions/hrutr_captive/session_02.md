# Hrutr the captive

## Session 02 - Finding my way home

![](img/session_02.jpg)

I spent some time lying in the terrain, and I can't say how long I was in that position. The crows started to come along, so I made an effort to stand up and prepare to leave that place. My body was about to collapse some time before and I needed to take care of my wounds as soon as possible. Thanks to my herbalist skills, I collected some herbs and roots around and at least tried to improve my superficial wounds.

> 5+2+1 - 4,4 *Strong Hit with a Match*
>
> +2 Health. Herbs told me about the place I was and facilitate the way back

After some rest and meditation, my mind was clear enough to find the next goal. I put myself on my knees, took my iron amulet from my neck, and closing my eyes, I swore by the iron that I won't stop until I find out what happened to my friend Hrodmar.

My settlement, Lowhaven, was attacked by another settlement, Tiza. Hrodmar was one of the guards of the small village. I was... sold? to two men that now lay here.

> 3+2+1 - 7,4 *Weak Hit*
> 
> +1 Momentum. I had my eyes covered, but I think I know the path.

I had my eyes covered all the way and my captives didn't survive. I inspected the bodies to find any information I could get.

> **Gather Information**
>
> 3+1 - 10,2 *Weak Hit*
>
> +1 Momentum. I discovered an unexpected scenario.

I knew one of my captives; an old member of my settlement that was expelled because of serious crimes. I have the feeling he was part of it and contributed to the assault.
