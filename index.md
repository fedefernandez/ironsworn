## Ironsworn

_Step into a world where your vows shape fate, and every choice leads to peril or triumph. In these tales, you'll follow a lone hero as they traverse the Ironlands, driven by unbreakable oaths. Through uncertain paths and darkened horizons, the dice will guide our story. Will you witness glory, or will the Ironlands claim another soul? Join me in chronicling these adventuresâ€”each step a promise, each promise a challenge._
